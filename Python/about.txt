Courses

Now that we’ve actually attached a database to our Django server and have started to appreciate the magic of ORMs, let’s put it to use!

Make a Django project and application for the wireframe below.

Bonus Features (Optional)
Make description a one-to-one relationship with the Course table rather than a row in the course table (intermediate).
Add a <button> that allows you to add comments about the courses and render a page with those comments (advanced)
